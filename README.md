This page is used to release the ESAD series dataset. 

The current version is **MESA** dataset published on IGARSS 2025.

## Dataset Description
A Benchmark Dataset for Multi-class Earth's Surface Anomaly Detection in VHR Images
- More than 20,000 very high resolution (VHR) image-level annotated remote sensing images (PNG format)
- 12 major significant Earth's surface anomalies
- Spatial Resolution is range from 0.2m - 1m
